Welcome to Random Developers Group 👋
🔍 Who are we?

We’re a small group of passionate developers brought together by one common goal: coding for fun. We love experimenting with new ideas, working on projects of all kinds, and learning from each other — from simple scripts to more complex apps, it all depends on the moment’s inspiration!
🤔 Why this name?

At first, we had no idea what to call ourselves… and then this name just felt right:

    We use different programming languages (Python, JavaScript, C#, etc.)

    We have diverse backgrounds (web, games, systems, AI...)

    And our ideas? Often random — but always exciting!

We may be a "random" group, but we’re united by our passion for tech. 🎯
💡 What we value

Above all, we believe in:

    Curiosity: This is a place to try, explore, break things, and build them again.

    The desire to learn: Everyone moves at their own pace, and we love sharing what we discover.

    Kindness and support: No competition, just collaboration.

🛠️ What you’ll find here
